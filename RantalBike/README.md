There are n bike-rental stops along your office route. At any of the stops you can
rent a bike and return the same at any of the next(forward) stops. (It is one-way
traffic only and you cannot go backward). For each possible departure point i and
each possible arrival point j the cost of the rent from i to j is known. Note that, it
is possible that the cost of renting for a direct route from i to j is higher than the
total cost of a series of shorter rentals. So it may be advantageous to hop on one bike,
make a short trip, return and take a next bike and so on. There is no extra charge for
changing the bikes in this way.
Give an efficient algorithm to determine the minimum cost of a trip by the bike from
each possible departure point i to each arrival point j. Also write the sequence of
rentals that gives the optimal solution.
